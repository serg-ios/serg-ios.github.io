When I am reading a book in a foreign language, I use Google Translate to translate those words that I don't understand.

If I want to save some words, I mark them as favourites, pressing the star button for each word.

This is very useful because if I go to [https://translate.google.es/](https://translate.google.es/), I sign in with the same account and I can export that words into a XLSX file.

When I press this button (3), the file is imported into my Google Drive.

### So...

I want to build an app that downloads this file from Google Drive and helps me learn the words with games, Apple Watch complications, widgets, etc.

## Where do I begin?

I created an empty SwiftUI project with UIKit App Delegate life cycle.

Then, I added `GoogleSignIn` and `GoogleAPIClientForREST/Drive` libraries to it, using CocoaPods.

To add CocoaPods to a project, run `pod init` in its main directory. If you don't have `pod` installed in your computer, check [this](https://cocoapods.org/).

```
ðŸ™ˆ ~/Desktop/my-vocabulary/MyVocabulary$pod init
Ignoring ffi-1.12.2 because its extensions are not built. Try: gem pristine ffi --version 1.12.2
Ignoring sassc-2.3.0 because its extensions are not built. Try: gem pristine sassc --version 2.3.0
Ignoring unf_ext-0.0.7.7 because its extensions are not built. Try: gem pristine unf_ext --version 0.0.7.7
[!] Existing Podfile found in directory
```

In my case, `Podfile` already exists, but the first time you run this command, it'll be created.

The deployment target of my app is iOS 14.0, but your `Podfile` must look like mine.
```
platform :ios, '14.0'

target 'MyVocabulary' do
  use_frameworks!
  pod 'GoogleSignIn'
  pod 'GoogleAPIClientForREST/Drive'
end
```

These libraries are necessary because I will need to authenticate myself in order to access my Google Drive files.

Finish and run `pod install`.

```
ðŸ™ˆ ~/Desktop/my-vocabulary/MyVocabulary$pod install
Ignoring ffi-1.12.2 because its extensions are not built. Try: gem pristine ffi --version 1.12.2
Ignoring sassc-2.3.0 because its extensions are not built. Try: gem pristine sassc --version 2.3.0
Ignoring unf_ext-0.0.7.7 because its extensions are not built. Try: gem pristine unf_ext --version 0.0.7.7

```

Once you've installed CocoaPods, close your project, open Xcode again and select your **workspace**. This is very important, otherwise, your project won't build.

## Google Sign In

The first thing that must be done is authentication with Google credentials in order to access Google Drive.
